To catch or detect the functionality of a binary file, you can use various tools and techniques on Linux. Here are some common approaches:

## Using the `file` command

The `file` command helps determine the type of file, including whether it is an executable binary or not.[4] For example:

```
$ file /bin/ls
/bin/ls: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=94943a89d17e9d373b2794dcb1f7e38c95b66c86, stripped
```

This shows that `/bin/ls` is an executable ELF binary file for the x86-64 architecture.

## Using the `readelf` command

If `file` identifies an ELF binary, you can use `readelf` to inspect its headers and sections to understand its functionality.[4] For example:

```
$ readelf -h /bin/ls
```

This displays the ELF header information like the entry point address, program headers, section headers, etc., which can give clues about its purpose.

## Using the `strings` command 

The `strings` command prints all printable strings found in a binary file, which can reveal debug messages, error messages, or other text that hints at its functionality.[4] For example:

```
$ strings /bin/ls | head
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
__gmon_start__
libc.so.6
...
```

This shows that `/bin/ls` is dynamically linked against the GNU C library.

## Disassembling the binary

You can use tools like `objdump`, `gdb`, or dedicated disassemblers like `radare2` to disassemble the binary and analyze the assembly instructions to understand what it does.[4] This requires knowledge of assembly language and reverse engineering skills.

## Tracing the execution

You can run the binary in a controlled environment like a virtual machine or sandbox, and trace its execution using tools like `strace`, `ltrace`, or kernel modules like `SystemTap`. This can reveal the system calls, library calls, and other low-level actions performed by the binary during execution, giving insights into its behavior.[4]

In summary, a combination of inspecting the file type, headers, strings, disassembling, and tracing can help catch or reverse engineer the functionality of an unknown binary file on Linux systems.[1][2][4]
